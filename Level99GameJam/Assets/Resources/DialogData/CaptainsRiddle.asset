  <DialogText>k__BackingField: 'If you wish to meet the sea

    you must leave
    the cove behind

    and the tower on your right

    will give you peace of
    mind.

    

    Behind the tower, hidden in the rocks,

    The entrance
    lies to a secret place.

    A place of treasure, a place of gold,

    But
    if you were clever and always bold,

    And find that you can swim like a fish,

    You
    can find the treasure chest

    And be rich beyond your wildest wish.'
  <DialogConfirmText>k__BackingField: Hmm...
